# Web Spectrogram (Modified for Selector Concert 11/23/19)
An insanely interactive live-input spectrogram with sound creation built in.

This project uses your microphone data to plot frequency over time in a moving window graph (The colors indicate the weight of that frequency at that time). You can use the scale controls button to change the y-axis (frequency) of the graph. Besides the graph, the menu allow you to turn the sound on as well as a bevy of new controls (more coming soon...) . Here are the sound making controls:

Once the sound is "On", you can draw on the spectrogram graph using your mouse or touch input to create a sine wave at the frequency specified. You can change volume/amplitude of the sine wave by sweeping left and right. Other controls include timbre choices, a scale mode to snap your notes to a scale, and various effects. There's also a tuning mode packed in to make it easier to tune instruments.
